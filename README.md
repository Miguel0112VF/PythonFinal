# PythonFinal

#The purpose of the code in this repository is to be able to measure in a given string the amount of observed substrings and possible substrings of any length as well as the linguistic complexity. 

#In this repository I have added the .pynb and .py files as well as their respective Markdowns because I did not know how to add the Markdowns directly into here.
